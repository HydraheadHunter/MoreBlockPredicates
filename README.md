# MoreBlockPredicates
Allows users to replace block models in the world in new ways!

# Known Issues
- Due to how fabric loads models/resources, you must reload assets twice to see changes appear. 
- You should disable "always tesselate block models" in sodium/indigo's config, or your changes will not reflect in game.
